# CLAUDE.md — hornlab-search

## Start here

1. **Read `docs/CONTINUITY.md` first.** It says which wave we are in, the last checkpoint passed,
   what is next, open blockers, and the measured numbers.
2. Read `docs/plan/01_CONTRACTS.md` completely (frozen), then **only your own task file**.
3. Read `TOOLCHAIN.md` for interpreter paths, pinned SHAs, and measured machine numbers.
4. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for branch / commit / PR rules and the 8 hard rules.

## RULE FOR EVERY PUSH, forever

**Every commit that is pushed updates `docs/CONTINUITY.md` and `docs/ISSUES.md` in that same commit.**
CONTINUITY gets a new dated entry at the top (newest first) and its status block refreshed;
ISSUES mirrors the open GitHub issues (ID, title, status, owner, plan reference). A push that
does not touch both is wrong.

## What this is

`hornlab-search` finds horn-loudspeaker geometry **by objective**: state a target (coverage, band,
ripple, throat size, a room), generate candidate geometry, solve each with GPU boundary-element
acoustics, score it, iterate (CMA-ES). It is a **search layer over Collin's HornLab packages**:
`hornlab_mesher` (geometry + gmsh), `hornlab_beat_bem` (GPU BEM), `hornlab_bempp_bem` (CPU BEM
cross-check), `hornlab_plots` (figures). We never write a solver, mesher, gmsh writer, Green's
function or plotting library, and never modify installed HornLab/BEAT/Julia files.
License: AGPL-3.0-or-later. Every horn number is a YAML default in `examples/`, never hardcoded.

Interpreter: always `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` (absolute path in `TOOLCHAIN.md`), never bare `python`.

## Wave plan

```
WAVE 0   02 env  ->  03 scaffold                               serial, one agent      (CP-0, CP-1)
WAVE 1   04 design+mesh | 05 solve | 06 metrics | 07 dataset    four agents, parallel  (CP-2..CP-5)
WAVE 2   08 pipeline                                            one agent              (CP-6, CP-7)
WAVE 3   09 checkpoints                                         senior, verify only
```

A wave starts only after the previous wave's checkpoints pass. Parallelism = writing code in
parallel. **One GPU, one solve at a time.** Dispatch prompts: verbatim template in
`docs/plan/00_ORCHESTRATOR.md`.

## The three silent killers

- **`mesh_scale`**: the mesher writes **metres** → `SolveConfig(mesh_scale=1.0)`. The beat README's
  `0.001` is for its mm example mesh. `mesh/build.py` asserts bbox is 0.1–1 m.
- **Quadrants vs symmetry flag** must derive from one source and be tested together.
- **DI provenance**: `MetricSet.di_source` is `"balloon"` or `"cuts_estimate"`; no checkpoint passes on
  `cuts_estimate`.

## Tests

`pytest` offline tests run in CI (Python 3.12). Tests that need a real solver/GPU/mesher run are
marked (see `tests/conftest.py`) and deselected in CI; they are run locally and pasted into PRs.

## GPU / Julia hygiene (measured 2026-10-12; applies to every agent)

`hornlab_beat_bem` runs solves in a **persistent Julia host** (`HORNLAB_BEAT_PERSISTENT_HOST=1`, idle
timeout 1800 s). Each host holds ~1 GB of VRAM (CUDA context) plus its memory pool. Measured on the
8 GB RTX 4060: `shutdown_workers()` does **not** reliably end the host, so hosts from earlier
processes pile up, and a later solve then crashes with `Warm BEAT Engine solver exited with code
1 / 4294967295`, or OOMs at a dof count that fits fine alone. Several "OOM" numbers were this, not
the real ceiling.

Rules:
1. **Before any GPU measurement, benchmark, or checkpoint run**, list and clear stale hosts, and confirm
   VRAM is near idle (the desktop alone uses ~0.3-0.5 GB):
   `Get-Process julia` then `taskkill /F /IM julia.exe`, then `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used --format=csv`.
   Only Julia processes this project started may be killed. On a shared machine, check the
   command line first.
2. **One measurement per fresh process, with Julia cleared between jobs.** Never compare VRAM or
   timings across solves of different meshes inside one warm worker (the pool keeps growing).
3. **Record the baseline** (`memory.used` before the solve) next to every peak-VRAM number.
4. **Never run two GPU jobs at once**, and don't run provisioning while measuring.
5. **Poll `nvidia-smi` from a separate process or thread.** A Python-side poll that reads 0 is a bug in
   the probe, not a result.
6. Every run script ends by clearing its workers. Task 05 (`solve/worker.py`) must verify the host
   really exits (check the process list) and test it. `detach_workers()` leaving a host warm is
   intended inside a search; it is not acceptable at the end of a measurement or checkpoint.
7. A solver crash or OOM is only a finding once it reproduces from a clean state (rule 1).
