"""Authored prose for the NATIVE mesher-family knobs (domain ``native``).

These are the keys of ``hornlab_search/design/families.py``'s own tables: the OSSE,
R-OSSE, ICW and FREEFORM mesher families. The module ONLY annotates them. It imports
nothing but :mod:`.schema`, so it stays import-light; it never imports numpy, the mesher,
the registry or the generator code.

NUMBERS RULE
    No default value and no hard limit is typed here. Every :class:`KnobDoc` carries
    ``default=None``, ``hard_lo=None`` and ``hard_hi=None`` on purpose. The builder lane
    reads the real numbers from ``families.KeySpec`` and the YAML seeds. Numbers inside a
    prose ``formula`` string are the published formula, not a configured value. The one
    disputed default (``exponent``) is stated as a documented mismatch, with both sources,
    and no winner is picked.

UNIT RULE
    The unit comes from the key suffix: ``_mm`` -> mm, ``_deg`` -> deg, ``_hz`` -> Hz.
    A name without a recognised suffix is dimensionless. Explicit exceptions, each also
    stated on the entry:

      * ``s1`` is mm/deg and ``s2`` is 1/mm, per the KeySpec notes in ``families.py``;
      * ``kappa0``, ``kappa_abs_max`` and each ``icw_coeffs`` value are 1/mm; ``icw_S``
        is mm (MESHER_TYPOLOGIES.md section 3a);
      * ``dkappa_ds_abs_max`` is left unitless: the mesher's solver docstring says
        ``max|dkappa/dsigma|`` and gives its own ambiguous wording, so no token is asserted;
      * ``hold_start`` / ``hold_end``, ``gcurve_dist`` and ``morph_fixed`` are fractions
        (of normalised arc length or of the main axial station);
      * ``n_coeff`` is an integer count, not a length;
      * ``morph_allow_shrinkage`` is a 0/1 flag;
      * ``mode``, ``termination``, ``pin_mouth_radius``, ``icw_seed``, ``gcurve_sf``,
        ``profileH``, ``profileV`` and ``crossSections`` are categorical / boolean /
        container keys and carry no unit.

CONTEXTS
    Context ids are domain-scoped. The base fields and the ``"native"`` context carry the
    general native meaning; ``"native:osse"``, ``"native:rosse"`` and ``"native:icw"``
    carry a family-specific meaning where one name genuinely changes law (``q``,
    ``L_mm``, ``R_mm``). Nothing here restates a generator or rows meaning.

LOOKUP
    ``LOOKUP`` is a mesher formula (``lookupProfile``, MESHER_TYPOLOGIES.md section 5)
    but it has no entry in ``families.FAMILY_KEYS`` and no shipped config, so it has no
    native knob table to annotate. It is recorded here, not fabricated as knobs.
